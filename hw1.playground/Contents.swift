import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: Not necisarily, the ? allows the argunments to the init to be nil possibly, though the variables in the class do not allow this. This could lead to an error at runtime.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool? {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: Removed part one per instructions an piazza. The function was declared as an instance method function instead of a class method function


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [:]//Line X
        var lenA : Int! = self.wordA.characters.count
        var lenB : Int! = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: We never instantiated the dictionary. Fixed that and then modified the return type so that it returned a Boolean when it should. Finally I changed the entire method from a class method to an instance method
